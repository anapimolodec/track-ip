## Overview

### :mega: The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses and see the key information and location

## My process

### :hammer: Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (with Flexbox)
- Javascript (with fetch calls)
- [Geo IPify API](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - For IP API
- [Leaflef JS](https://leafletjs.com/) - for showing map
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - for free deployment


### :muscle: What I learned

I have practiced fetching from API and learnt how to use GeoIPify API and how to embed a map into the website. Also, I tried to use glassmorphism for some elements. 

### :star2: Useful resources

- [Glassmorphism Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW0Z1T8l7sU&t=420s&ab_channel=OnlineTutorials) - good video tutorials on CSS, JS, HTML
- [uiGradients](https://uigradients.com/#IbizaSunset/) - collection of appealing gradients
